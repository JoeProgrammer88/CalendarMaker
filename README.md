# Calendar Customizer

A fully client-side React + TypeScript web application for designing printable photo calendars (cover + monthly pages + yearly overview) with multi-photo layouts, image transforms, events, and optional common US holidays. All image processing and data persistence happen locally (IndexedDB / LocalStorage) to preserve privacy and reduce hosting costs.

## ‚ú® Key Goals
- 100% client-side: no backend required.
- High-quality print output (target 300 DPI export PDF / PNG).
- Simple, guided customization (sizes, layouts, photos, events, fonts).
- Offline-capable (PWA) foundation.

## ‚úÖ Current Feature Set
- Project scaffold (Vite + React + TS + Tailwind + Zustand).
- Page sizes & orientation (5√ó7, Letter, A4, 11√ó17, 13√ó19).
- Split toggle: Top/Bottom vs Left/Right; selecting L/R auto-switches to 5√ó7 Landscape.
- Multi-layout system (single, dual, triple, quad, full-bleed) with LR variants; dual/triple TB use exact 50% photo/50% grid.
- Photo upload library, thumbnails, per-slot assignment.
- Non-destructive transforms per slot (zoom, pan, rotate, reset).
- Calendar grid with month label inside the header, optional ISO week numbers.
- Events: add/edit/delete via modal (double‚Äëclick a day), visibility toggle; render in grid.
- (Per-month caption removed.)
- Yearly Overview page (optional) with mini-month grids; basic US holiday highlights.
- Cover page (optional): Large Photo (90% photo) or 4√ó3 Month Grid (12 thumbnails), both with a 10% date range footer.
- PDF export: vector text (standard fonts), photos at ~300 DPI, precise grid lines (no header underline), shaded header background, progress indicator.
- Dark / light UI theme toggle.
- Keyboard transforms (arrows/+/-) and selection guards.
- Error toasts; ‚ÄúClear all data‚Äù action.
- Export current page as PNG.
- Persistence: autosave/restore with IndexedDB (photos) + LocalStorage (last project), schema version + migrate stub.
- PWA: precaching via Vite PWA (Workbox) with runtime caching (assets/Google Fonts); ready for GitHub Pages deploy (base path + SPA 404).

## ‚è≥ In Progress / Remaining
- PDF font embedding/subsetting polish (embed TTFs when available; fallback works).
- Expanded holiday dataset and cross‚Äëyear handling (overview).
- Resolution warnings for low‚Äëres images (stretch).
- Export progress UI polish (modal with cancel).
- Accessibility polish (ARIA/focus, shortcuts refinement).

## üß± Future / Nice-to-Have (Post-MVP)

## üõ† Tech Stack
| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Build | Vite | Fast HMR, ESM |
| Lang | TypeScript | Strict mode |
| UI | React 18 | Functional components |
| State | Zustand + Immer | Lightweight, simple actions |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first, fast iteration |
| Dates | date-fns | Pure functions, tree-shakeable |
| Storage | IndexedDB (idb-keyval) + LocalStorage | Photos + project state |
| PDF | pdf-lib | Vector text & drawing |
| Image Perf | createImageBitmap / Canvas | Planned for transforms |
| PWA | Vite PWA (Workbox) | Offline shell + runtime caching |

## üìÇ Project Structure
```

  main.tsx            # Entry
  styles.css          # Tailwind entry
  types.ts            # Type definitions

## üöÄ Getting Started
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Visit http://localhost:5173 (default Vite port).

## ÔøΩ Deploy to GitHub Pages

This repo is preconfigured for GitHub Pages project hosting.

- Base path is set to `/CalendarMaker/` in `vite.config.ts`.
- PWA manifest `start_url` and `scope` target `/CalendarMaker/`.
- SPA routing fallback is handled by copying `dist/index.html` ‚Üí `dist/404.html` during build.
- A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`) builds and publishes Pages.

Steps:
1) Push changes to the `main` branch.
2) In your GitHub repository, go to Settings ‚Üí Pages and set Source to ‚ÄúGitHub Actions‚Äù.
3) Wait for the workflow to complete; your site will be available at:
  https://JoeProgrammer88.github.io/CalendarMaker/

Local build/preview (optional):
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Notes:
- If you fork/rename the repo, update `base` in `vite.config.ts` and the PWA `start_url/scope` to match the new repo path.
- For a custom domain, set `base: '/'` and update PWA `start_url/scope` accordingly.
- PWA uses auto-update; if you ever see stale assets, hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) or unregister the SW in DevTools.

## ÔøΩüîß NPM Scripts
| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| dev | Start Vite dev server |
| build | Production build |
| preview | Preview production build |
| typecheck | Run TypeScript compiler w/o emit |

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Development Workflow
1. Select a page size, orientation, and layout (use Split toggle for TB/LR).
2. Upload photos and assign to slots; adjust transforms.
3. Add events; toggle week numbers or Overview holidays if desired.
4. Optional: Include a Cover page and choose the style.
5. Export multi-page PDF for printing.

## üß™ Testing Strategy (Planned)
- Pure functions (calendar generation, layout scaling) via unit tests (future Jest / Vitest setup).
- Visual regression (future) for export rendering.

## üíæ Persistence Plan
- IndexedDB: Photo original + preview blobs.
- JSON Project Object: Calendar settings, slots, events.
- Auto-save debounce (~1s) & manual ‚ÄúReset Project‚Äù.

## üìÖ Roadmap (Milestones)
| Milestone | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Scaffold & Layout Registry | Done |
| Photo Upload + Slot Assignment | Done |
